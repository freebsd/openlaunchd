.El
.Sh XML PROPERTY LIST KEYS
The follow keys can be used to describe the configuration details of your daemon or agent.
Property lists are Apple's standard configuration file format. Please see
.Xr plist 5
for more information. Please note. Property list files are expected to have their name end in ".plist".
.Pp
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy Label <string>
This required key uniquely identifies the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy Disabled <boolean>
This optional key is used to disable your job. The default is false.
.It Sy UserName <string>
This optional key specifies the user to run the job as. The default is the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy GroupName <string>
This optional key specifies the user to run the job as. The default is the group of the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy inetdCompatibility <dictionary>
The presence of this key specifies that the daemon expects to be run as if it were launched from inetd.
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy Wait <boolean>
This flag corresponds to the "wait" or "nowait" option of inetd. If true, then the listening socket is passed via the standard in/out/error file descriptors. If false, then
.Xr accept 2
is called on behalf of the job, and the result is passed via the standard in/out/error descriptors.
.El
.It Sy LimitLoadToHosts <array of strings>
This configuration file only applies to the hosts listed with this key.
.It Sy LimitLoadFromHosts <array of strings>
This configuration file only applies to hosts NOT listed with this key.
.It Sy LimitLoadToSessionType <string>
This configuration file only applies to sessions of the type specified. This key is used
in concert with the -S flag to
.Nm launchctl .
.It Sy ProgramArguments <array of strings>
This required key maps to the second argument of
.Xr execvp 3 .
.It Sy Program <string>
This optional key maps to the first argument of
.Xr execvp 3 .
If this key is missing, then the first element of the array of strings provided to the ProgramArguments will be used instead.
.It Sy EnableGlobbing <boolean>
This flag causes
.Nm launchd
to use the
.Xr glob 3
mechanism to update the program arguments before invocation.
.It Sy KeepAlive <boolean or dictionary of stuff>
This optional key is used to control whether your job is to be kept
continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the invocation. The
default is false and therefore only demand will start the job. The value may be
set to true to unconditionally keep the job alive. Alternatively, a dictionary
of conditions may be specified to selectively control whether
.Nm launchd
keeps a job alive or not. If multiple keys are provided, launchd ORs them, thus
providing maximum flexibility to the job to refine the logic and stall if necessary. If
.Nm launchd
finds no reason to restart the job, it falls back on demand based invocation.
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy SuccessfulExit <boolean>
If true, the job will be restarted as long as the program exits and with an exit
status of zero.  If false, the job will be restarted in the inverse condition.
This key implies that "RunAtLoad" is set to true, since the job needs to run at
least once before we can get an exit status.
.It Sy NetworkState <boolean>
If true, the job will be kept alive as long as the network is up, where up is
defined as at least one non-loopback interface being up and having IPv4 or IPv6
addresses assigned to them.
If false, the job will be kept alive in the inverse condition.
.It Sy PathState <dictionary of booleans>
Each key in this dictionary is a file-system path. If the value of the key is
true, then the job will be kept alive as long as the path exists.
If false, the job will be kept alive in the inverse condition. The intent of this
feature is that two or more jobs may create semaphores in the file-system namespace.
.El
.It Sy RunAtLoad <boolean>
This optional key is used to control whether your job is launched once at the time the job is loaded. The default is false.
.It Sy RootDirectory <string>
This optional key is used to specify a directory to
.Xr chroot 2
to before running the job.
.It Sy WorkingDirectory <string>
This optional key is used to specify a directory to
.Xr chdir 2
to before running the job.
.It Sy ServiceDescription <string>
This optional key is used to specify a human readable description of the purpose of the job.
.It Sy EnvironmentVariables <dictionary of strings>
This optional key is used to specify additional environmental variables to be setup before running the job.
.It Sy Umask <integer>
This optional key specifies what value should be passed to
.Xr umask 2
before running the job. Known bug: Property lists don't support octal, so please convert the value to decimal.
.It Sy TimeOut <integer>
The recommended time out (in seconds) to pass to the job. If no value is specified, a default time out will be supplied by
.Nm launchd
for use by the job at check in time.
.It Sy InitGroups <boolean>
This optional key specifies whether the job should have
.Xr initgroups 3
be called before running the job.
The default is false.
.It Sy WatchPaths <array of strings>
This optional key causes the job to be started if any one of the listed paths are modified.
.It Sy QueueDirectories <array of strings>
Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modifications. The difference being that the job will only be started if the path is a directory and the directory is not empty.
.It Sy StartInterval <integer>
This optional key causes the job to be started every N seconds.
If the system is asleep, the job will be started the next time the computer
wakes up.  If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is woken, those
events will be coalesced into one event upon wake from sleep.
.It Sy StartCalendarInterval <dictionary of integers or array of dictionary of integers>
This optional key causes the job to be started every calendar interval as specified. Missing arguments are considered to be wildcard. The semantics are much like
.Xr crontab 5 .
Unlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep, launchd
will start the job the next time the computer wakes up.  If multiple intervals
transpire before the computer is woken, those events will be coalesced into one
event upon wake from sleep.
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy Minute <integer>
The minute on which this job will be run.
.It Sy Hour <integer>
The hour on which this job will be run.
.It Sy Day <integer>
The day on which this job will be run.
.It Sy Weekday <integer>
The weekday on which this job will be run (0 and 7 are Sunday).
.It Sy Month <integer>
The month on which this job will be run.
.El
.It Sy StandardOutPath <string>
This optional key specifies what file should be used for data being sent to stdout when using
.Xr stdio 3 .
.It Sy StandardErrorPath <string>
This optional key specifies what file should be used for data being sent to stderr when using
.Xr stdio 3 .
.It Sy Debug <boolean>
This optional key specifies that
.Nm launchd
should adjust its log mask temporarily to LOG_DEBUG while dealing with this job.
.It Sy WaitForDebugger <boolean>
This optional key specifies that
.Nm launchd
should instruct the kernel to have the job wait for a debugger to attach before any code in the job is executed.
.It Sy SoftResourceLimits <dictionary of integers>
.It Sy HardResourceLimits <dictionary of integers>
Resource limits to be imposed on the job. These adjust variables set with
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
The following keys apply:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy Core <integer>
The largest size (in bytes) core file that may be created.
.It Sy CPU <integer>
The maximum amount of cpu time (in seconds) to be used by each process.
.It Sy Data <integer>
The maximum size (in bytes) of the data segment for a process; this defines how far a program may extend its break with the
.Xr sbrk 2
system call.
.It Sy FileSize <integer>
The largest size (in bytes) file that may be created.
.It Sy MemoryLock <integer>
The maximum size (in bytes) which a process may lock into memory using the
.Xr mlock 2
function.
.It Sy NumberOfFiles <integer>
The maximum number of open files for this process.
.It Sy NumberOfProcesses <integer>
The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id.
.It Sy ResidentSetSize <integer>
The maximum size (in bytes) to which a process's resident set size may grow.
This imposes a limit on the amount of physical memory to be given to a process;
if memory is tight, the system will prefer to take memory from processes that
are exceeding their declared resident set size.
.It Sy Stack <integer>
The maximum size (in bytes) of the stack segment for a process; this defines
how far a program's stack segment may be extended.  Stack extension is
performed automatically by the system.
.El
.It Sy Nice <integer>
This optional key specifies what
.Xr nice 3
value should be applied to the daemon.
.It Sy LowPriorityIO <boolean>
This optional key specifies whether the kernel should consider this daemon to be low priority when doing file system I/O.
.It Sy MachServices <dictionary of booleans>
This optional key is used to specify Mach services to be registered with the
Mach bootstrap sub-system.  Each key in this dictionary should be the name of
service to be advertised.  The value of the key must be a boolean. If the
boolean is true, the port is recycled, thus leaving clients to remain oblivious
to the demand nature of job. If the value is set to false, clients receive port
death notifications when the job lets go of the receive right. The port will be
recreated atomically with respect to bootstrap_look_up() calls, so that clients
can trust that after receiving a port death notification, the new port will
have already been recreated. Setting the value to false should be done with
care. Not all clients may be able to handle this behavior. Finally, for the job
itself, the values will be replaced with Mach ports at the time of check-in
with
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy Sockets <dictionary of dictionaries... OR dictionary of array of dictionaries...>
This optional key is used to specify launch on demand sockets that can be used to let
.Nm launchd
know when to run the job. The job must check-in to get a copy of the file descriptors using APIs outlined in
.Xr launch 3 .
The keys of the top level Sockets dictionary can be anything. They are meant for the application developer to use to
differentiate different which descriptors correspond to which application level protocols (e.g. http vs. ftp vs. DNS...).
At check in time, the value of each Sockets dictionary key will be an array of descriptors. Daemon/Agent writers should
consider all descriptors of a given key to be to be effectively equivalent, even though each file descriptor likely represents
a different networking protocol which conforms to the criteria specified in the job configuration file.
.Pp
The paramters below are used as inputs to call
.Xr getaddrinfo 3 .
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy SockType <string>
This optional key tells
.Nm launchctl
what type of socket to create. The default is "stream" and other valid values for this key
are "dgram" and "seqpacket" respectively.
.It Sy SockPassive <boolean>
This optional key specifies whether
.Xr listen 2
or
.Xr connect 2
should be called on the created file descriptor. The default is true ("to listen").
.It Sy SockNodeName <string>
This optional key specifies the node to
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr bind 2
to.
.It Sy SockServiceName <string>
This optional key specifies the service on the node to
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr bind 2
to.
.It Sy SockFamily <string>
This optional key can be used to specifically request that "IPv4" or "IPv6" socket(s) be created.
.It Sy SockProtocol <string>
This optional key specifies the protocol to be passed to
.Xr socket 2 .
The only value understood by this key at the moment is "TCP".
.It Sy SockPathName <string>
This optional key implies SockFamily is set to "Unix". It specifies the path to
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr bind 2
to.
.It Sy SockPathMode <integer>
This optional key specifies the mode of the socket. Known bug: Property lists don't support octal, so please convert the value to decimal.
.It Sy Bonjour <boolean or string or array of strings>
This optional key can be used to request that the service be registered with the
.Xr mDNSResponder 8 .
If the value is boolean, the service name is inferred from the SockServiceName.
.It Sy MulticastGroup <string>
This optional key can be used to request that the datagram socket join a multicast group.
If the value is a hostname, then
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
will be used to join the correct multicast address for a given socket family.
If an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address is given, it is required that the SockFamily family also be set, otherwise the results are undefined.

.Sh DEPENDENCIES
Unlike many bootstrapping daemons, launchd has no explicit dependency model.
Interdependencies are expected to be solved through the use of IPC.
It is therefore in the best interest of a job developer who expects dependents
to define all of the sockets in the configuration file. This has the added
benefit of making it possible to start the job based on demand instead of
immediately.
.Sh EXAMPLE XML PROPERTY LISTS
